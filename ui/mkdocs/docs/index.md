# Welcome to SCANEO

SCANEO allows you to annotate satellite imagery with a user-friendly interface.

- Display imagery and pick the bands and range you want to see
- Add classification, segmentation and detection labels to your imagery
- Can perform multiple labelling tasks on a single image
- Use local files or S3 buckets
- Export annotations in GeoJSON format
- Assisted labelling with AI models
- Integration with [EOTDL](https://eotdl.com).

## Why SCANEO?

One of the most limiting factors in the development of machine learning models for satellite imagery is the cost of labeled data. SCANEO aims to alleviate this issue by providing an efficient labelling workflow, reducing the time and cost of creating labeled data.

This documentation aims to guide users through the installation, setup, and operational procedures of SCANEO.
